# classeviva-mcp

A self-hosted MCP server for the [ClasseViva](https://web.spaggiari.eu/) school
register, running on Cloudflare Workers. It exposes 14 tools over Streamable HTTP,
guarded by Cloudflare Access, and is built to be deployed for one account at a
time — see [Configure your own](#configure-your-own) for your own instance.

Responses are compacted before they reach the model. The school calendar, for
instance, goes from 22 KB to 2 KB without losing the answer to "is there school on
the 14th".

## How it fits together

```
MCP client ──OAuth──> workers-oauth-provider ──> createMcpHandler ──> tools
                             │                                          │
                     Cloudflare Access                          ClasseViva client
                     (identity only)                          (login, compaction)

browser ──HMAC-signed link──> /attachment ──────────────────────────> PDF
```

- **Identity** comes from a Cloudflare Access for SaaS (OIDC) app. `ALLOWED_EMAILS`
  decides who may use the server; everyone else is refused a token and, failing
  that, sees zero tools.
- **Attachments** sit outside the OAuth gate and carry their own proof — see
  [Attachments](#attachments).
- **Register credentials** are Worker secrets; a caller never sees them.
- **State**: none. Each request logs in to ClasseViva unless a warm isolate still
  holds a valid token (they last 90 minutes).

## Tools

| Tool | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `profile` | Who am I, which school, which subjects and teachers, which terms |
| `grades` | Marks, with averages overall, per subject and per term |
| `agenda` | Homework and scheduled work, defaults to the next 14 days |
| `lessons` | What was actually covered in class, consecutive hours merged |
| `absences` | Absences, late arrivals, early leaves, with totals |
| `notes` | Disciplinary notes, text included |
| `noticeboard` | School notices, with a link per attachment |
| `read_notice` | A notice's full body — **marks it as read** |
| `read_attachment` | An attachment's text, so the model can read it — **marks the notice as read** |
| `calendar` | School days as date ranges |
| `schoolbooks` | Adopted textbooks |
| `didactics` | Material shared by teachers |
| `documents` | Documents and school reports |
| `summary` | Everything for a date range in one call |

Every read-only tool takes `format: "raw"` to bypass compaction and return the
API's own JSON.

There is also one resource (`classeviva://profile`) and two prompts
(`week-review`, `whats-due`).

## Attachments

A notice attachment is a real PDF — around 200 KB in practice, roughly 270 KB once
base64-encoded. Returning those bytes through MCP would fill the model's context
with something it cannot read anyway, so there are two separate paths instead.

**For a person:** `noticeboard` returns a link per attachment.

```json
"attachments": [
  {
    "fileName": "Avviso 021.pdf",
    "attachNum": 1,
    "url": "https://your-domain/attachment/CF/90000003/1?exp=1789565932&sig=tD9ig…"
  }
]
```

Open it in a browser and the file downloads. A browser sends no `Authorization`
header, so the route cannot sit behind the OAuth token — the link carries its own
proof instead: an HMAC over `evtCode/pubId/attachNum` **and** the expiry, signed
with `LINK_SIGNING_KEY`, which only the Worker knows. Changing the attachment
number or extending the expiry invalidates the signature. Links last one hour;
after that, ask for the notice again to get a fresh one.

**For the model:** `read_attachment` fetches the same file and converts it with
Workers AI `toMarkdown`, returning a few KB of text instead of the bytes. It works
on images too, though those get described rather than transcribed. Output is capped
at 20,000 characters, with `truncated: true` when it was cut.

### Both of them mark the notice as read

ClasseViva refuses to serve an attachment for a notice that has never been opened:

```
GET  /noticeboard/attach/CF/90000002/1  →  404 "item must first be read"
POST /noticeboard/read/CF/90000002/101  →  200, marks it read
GET  /noticeboard/attach/CF/90000002/1  →  200 application/pdf
```

So both paths open the notice first, and that cannot be undone. This mirrors the
web app, where a file is only reachable by opening the notice that carries it.

It marks the notice **read**. It does not **sign** — `needSign` is a separate
action this code never performs, and stayed `true` on every notice requiring a
signature across a full run of all attachments.

`/attachment/*` deliberately stays at the root while the MCP endpoint sits under a
path prefix. `workers-oauth-provider` matches API routes with `startsWith`, so
anything under the MCP prefix would be swallowed by the OAuth gate — and these
links would stop working.

## Configure your own

Nothing in this repo is specific to one school or one student except the values
you set below. Configuration is split in two, by whether it is safe to commit:

| | Where | Committed? | How to change it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Secrets** | `.env`, uploaded on deploy | never | edit `.env`, then `npm run deploy` |
| **Deployment config** | `wrangler.jsonc` | yes | edit, then `npm run deploy` |

The deploy script is `wrangler deploy --secrets-file .env`, so **`.env` is the
source of truth for production secrets** and one command pushes both code and
credentials. Three things follow from that:

- A missing `.env` makes the deploy **fail outright** with `ENOENT` — it does not
  deploy without them. A fresh clone has to create it first.
- Everything in `.env` is uploaded, so keep it to the nine names in
  `.env.example` and nothing else.
- Uploading is **additive**: secrets already on the Worker but absent from the file
  are preserved, not deleted.

`.env` also feeds `npm run dev`, so the same file covers local development.

Two behaviours that are easy to get backwards: `vars` in `wrangler.jsonc` are wiped
and rewritten on every deploy, while **secrets are never deleted by a deploy**.

### 1. Cloudflare Access application

Zero Trust → Access → Applications → Add an application → **SaaS**, protocol
**OIDC**. Redirect URL `https://<your-domain>/callback`, scopes `openid email
profile`. Add a policy allowing your email; **One-time PIN** sends you a code by
email and needs no third-party identity provider.

Keep five values from that page: Client ID, Client secret, Authorization endpoint,
Token endpoint, Key (JWKS) endpoint.

### 2. KV namespace

```bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create OAUTH_KV
```

It stores OAuth grants and tokens. Put the printed id in `wrangler.jsonc`.

### 3. `wrangler.jsonc`

Five things to change:

```jsonc
"name": "classeviva-mcp",                                  // your Worker's name
"kv_namespaces": [{ "binding": "OAUTH_KV", "id": "…" }],   // from step 2
"vars": {
    "ALLOWED_EMAILS": "you@example.com",                   // who may use it
    "PUBLIC_HOSTNAME": "mcp.example.com",                  // your custom domain
    "MCP_ROUTE": "/classeviva"                             // the MCP endpoint's path
},
"routes": [{ "pattern": "mcp.example.com", "custom_domain": true }]
```

`ALLOWED_EMAILS` is not a secret — it is a list of who is allowed in, not a
credential, so `vars` is the right home for it. Empty denies everyone: it fails
closed. A comma separates several addresses.

`PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` exists for Host-header validation. `localhost` and
`*.workers.dev` are allowed by default, so **deploying to workers.dev needs neither
this var nor the `routes` block** — drop both and the `*.workers.dev` URL from the
deploy just works. A custom domain gets no such allowance and must be named here,
or every request is rejected.

`MCP_ROUTE` is the path the MCP endpoint is served at. It defaults to
`/classeviva` — most forks can leave it alone; change the value if you want a
different URL segment, but keep the key present.

### 4. Secrets

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the nine values — five from step 1, two
you generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`, and your two ClasseViva credentials.
They upload on the next deploy.

To rotate a single value later without touching the file, or to set one on a Worker
you are not deploying to right now:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put CLASSEVIVA_PASSWORD
```

That takes effect immediately, no deploy needed. `npx wrangler secret list` shows
what the Worker currently holds — expect exactly those nine names.

When piping a value in, use `printf` rather than `echo`, so no trailing newline
lands inside the secret:

```bash
printf '%s' "$CLASSEVIVA_PASSWORD" | npx wrangler secret put CLASSEVIVA_PASSWORD
```

### 5. Deploy

```bash
npm install
npm run cf-typegen   # regenerates worker-configuration.d.ts from wrangler.jsonc
npm run deploy
```

`cf-typegen` is gitignored and derived — run it again any time you change
`wrangler.jsonc`'s `vars`, or `tsc`/your editor will type-check against stale
values.

That uploads the code, the `wrangler.jsonc` config, and the secrets from `.env` in
one go. The first deploy also creates the DNS record for a custom domain.

For local work, `npm run dev` serves on `localhost:8788` reading the same `.env`.
If you prefer Wrangler's own `.dev.vars` file, be aware it **shadows** `.env`
entirely rather than merging — every value the Worker needs has to be in it.

## Connecting

Dynamic client registration means there is no client ID to paste anywhere.

The path below is `/classeviva`, the shipped default — substitute your own if
you changed `MCP_ROUTE` in `wrangler.jsonc`.

- **claude.ai, Desktop, Cowork, mobile:** Settings → Connectors → Add custom
  connector → `https://<your-domain>/classeviva`
- **Claude Code:**
  `claude mcp add --transport http classeviva https://<your-domain>/classeviva`

Either way the browser opens for the Access login. Adding it from the claude.ai
connector panel and from Claude Code are different things — a connector added on
the web syncs down to Claude Code, but one added locally does not appear on the web.

## Verifying a change

There is no test suite. Before a deploy:

```bash
npm run type-check
npm run deploy
```

Then, against the deployed Worker (again, `/classeviva` is the default path —
adjust if you changed `MCP_ROUTE`):

```bash
# unauthenticated access must be refused
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST https://<your-domain>/classeviva \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'   # expect 401

# an unsigned attachment link must be refused
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' \
  https://<your-domain>/attachment/CF/1/1                # expect 400
```

`ALLOWED_EMAILS` is the only thing between a public URL and the register, so a
`200` on the first of those means stop and fix it before going further.

Note that MCP reports tool failures **inside** the response body with HTTP `200`.
A Cloudflare log showing `status: 200` and `outcome: ok` only means the request
authenticated and the Worker did not crash — to know whether a tool succeeded,
look for `isError` in the body.

## What the API will not give you

Only the current school year is retrievable, and a date range may not end later
than today. Previous years are gone, so any archive has to be built as you go.

`docs/endpoints.md` records that and the rest of what was verified against the live
service — including five places where the obvious call is the wrong one, from the
student id that must be digits only to the attachment segment that is not the
constant the original wrapper assumed.
