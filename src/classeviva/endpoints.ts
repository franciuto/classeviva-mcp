/**
 * ClasseViva REST API endpoints.
 *
 * Ported from `collegamenti.py` of the Python wrapper (Lioydiano/Classeviva, MIT),
 * with two corrections verified against the live API:
 *
 *  - `absencesFromTo` uses the 3-segment template. The original reused the
 *    `absencesFrom` one (2 placeholders) and passed 3 arguments, so the end date
 *    was silently dropped.
 *  - `noticeboardAttach` takes `attachNum` as its last segment. The original
 *    hardcoded `/101`, which returns 404: that segment is the attachment number,
 *    which comes from `attachments[].attachNum`.

 * On the `attach` path the same `101` is wrong — there the segment is `attachNum`.
